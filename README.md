# Kiba-CSS

Kiba-CSS (Keep It BEM-aligned with CSS Utilities) is a starter CSS framework that combines the power of [BEM methodology](https://getbem.com) with utility classes, providing the best of both worlds.

It is designed to serve as a solid foundation for web projects, allowing developers to build upon it and customize it according to their specific needs.

With Kiba-CSS, you can kickstart your project with a well-organized and modular code structure, thanks to the BEM methodology. This ensures that your styles are maintainable and scalable as your project grows.

Additionally, Kiba-CSS offers a wide range of utility classes, enabling you to apply quick and easy styling to your elements.

## Combining BEM Components with Other Frameworks

One of the benefits of using Kiba-CSS is the possibility to use BEM components with other frameworks or libraries, such as Tailwind.

Kiba-CSS provides standalone BEM components that can be used without the need for any utility classes, allowing for greater flexibility in styling.
This also means that developers can use Kiba-CSS BEM components with utility classes of other frameworks, creating a seamless and efficient styling experience.

## Available BEM Components

Kiba-CSS currently offers the following BEM components:

- Container
- Grid
- Form
- Button
- Table
- Navigation

These components could actually be added to any project with BEM architecture. It can be easily customized and extended to fit the specific needs.
